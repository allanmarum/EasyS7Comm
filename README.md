## ⚠️ Important Notice

**EasyS7Comm** is currently in the early stages of development and **is not ready for use**.

## Description

EasyS7Comm is a simplified abstraction of the powerful [Python-Snap7](https://github.com/gijzelaerr/python-snap7) tool. This project was created to make Snap7 **accessible to automation professionals with limited programming knowledge**. With EasyS7Comm, you can perform read and write operations on variables quickly and efficiently using minimal code.

While EasyS7Comm abstracts some of [Python-Snap7](https://github.com/gijzelaerr/python-snap7)'s advanced features, this trade-off is ideal for those who need straightforward and easy-to-use automation solutions.
