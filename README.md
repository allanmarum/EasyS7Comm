## ⚠️ Important Notice

**EasyS7Comm** is currently in the early stages of development and **is not ready for use**.

## Description

EasyS7Comm is a simplified abstraction of the powerful Snap7 tool, developed in Python. This project was created to make Snap7 accessible to automation professionals with limited programming knowledge. With EasyS7Comm, you can perform read and write operations on variables quickly and efficiently using minimal code.

While EasyS7Comm abstracts some of Snap7's advanced features, this trade-off is ideal for those who need straightforward and easy-to-use automation solutions.

## Features

- **Read Variables:** Easily read PLC variables with just a few lines of code.
- **Write Variables:** Quickly and simply write values to PLC variables.
- **Simplified Connection:** Intuitively connect to S7 PLCs.
- **Error Management:** Built-in error handling for safer operations.

## Installation

You can install EasyS7Comm directly via pip:

```bash
pip install easys7comm
```

Or clone the repository and install manually:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EasyS7Comm.git
cd EasyS7Comm
python setup.py install
```

## Basic Usage

Here's a quick example to read/write PLC variables:
